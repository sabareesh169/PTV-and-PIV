The purpose of this project is to find the fluid velocity from the images of a particle laden flow. There is a lot of research done into this problem which is called the Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV)/Particle Tracking Velocimetry(PTV) in Mechanical Engineering. The general methods followed for PIV is to break the field in frame 1 into interrogation windows and find the window with the highest correlation in the second frame to approximate the velocity at the position of interrogation window.
